				<h2 class="major">About</h2>
				<p>Hi, I’m Decency! With 8 years of experience as a registered nurse, I’ve worked across
					various fields — ophthalmic, general surgery, medical wards, and intensive care. My journey in
					healthcare taught me the value of precision, problem-solving, and continuous learning.</p>

				<p>Along the way, I developed a deep passion for technology and how it impacts every industry. This
					fascination led me to teach myself web development, where I’ve learned to craft beautiful,
					functional websites. Today, I help businesses and individuals bring their ideas online, creating
					websites that are not only visually appealing but also user-friendly and effective in reaching a
					wider audience.</p>

				<p>Whether you're a small business, a startup, or an individual with a vision, I’m here to help you
					create a strong online presence that stands out.<a href="#portfolio" class="myPortfolioLinks"> See

				<h3>My Journey into Programming: From ICU Nurse to Tech Enthusiast</h3>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/programming-blog.webp" alt="image of a programming language"
						loading="lazy" /></span>

				<p>My journey into programming began on November 17, 2024. By profession, I’m a registered nurse, and
					I’ve worked in various specialties. Currently, I’m an ICU nurse and also pursuing my master’s degree
					in advanced practice nursing. I absolutely love my work—caring for critically ill patients and
					striving to provide the best nursing care I can. However, I’ve also been fascinated by how
					technology is transforming healthcare delivery, and I want to be part of that change.</p>

				<p>Although I’ve only been on this programming journey for less than 5 months, I’ve already taught
					myself the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and am now diving into React. Using these
					technologies, I’ve created static webpages and several small apps, all of which you can explore on
					my <a href="#portfolio" target="_blank" class="myPortfolioLinks">portfolio page</a>.</p>

				<p>The path has definitely come with its challenges. Balancing a 12-hour shift, coupled with 3-hour
					daily commutes, hasn’t been easy. But despite the exhaustion, I’ve managed to stay motivated and
					push through. I’m not trying to pat myself on the back, but I’m proud of the effort I’ve put in so
					far.</p>

				<p>I’ve started this blog to document my journey—both the highs and the lows. I plan to write about the
					technologies I’ve studied, the projects I’ve worked on, and the lessons I’ve learned along the way.
					This blog will serve as a record of my progress and a way to reflect on how far I’ve come.</p>

				<p>If you happen to come across my website or blog, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Please feel free to
					<a href="mailto:deelovestocode@gmail.com" class="myPortfolioLinks">email me</a> any suggestions,
					tips, or advice on how to make this
					journey smoother. I’d really
					appreciate it.

					<h3>Coding Challenge Day 2: Building a weather app with react + typescript.</h3>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/100daysofcode.webp"
							alt="poster on the 100 days of code challenge" loading="lazy" /></span>

					<p>Today has been a successful day for me, and I hope the same for you! It's Day 2 of
						#100DaysOfCode, and I’ve managed to develop a mini weather app. It's not deployed yet, but
						that's my goal for tomorrow. Aside from coding and developing my technical skills, I've also
						been focusing on improving my time management. I realized I could easily spend the whole day on
						my laptop, especially after eating and showering. I tend to avoid distractions like video games,
						which is a good thing, but I want to strike a better balance.

						I came across a concept called the 8-8-8 rule: 8 hours of work, 8 hours of sleep, and 8 hours of
						leisure with family or friends, or anything non-work related. I didn't fully implement it today,
						but it's something I'm working towards. Anyway, back to the weather app I built. I’ll share my
						key takeaways, challenges, reflections, and goals under the following headings:</p>
					<section>
						<h4>learning point:</h4>

						<p>1. <b>Axios & useEffect</b>:
							Axios is a popular library in React used to fetch data, similar to the fetch API in vanilla
							JavaScript. I’ve used Axios before, so I’m familiar with how to fetch data and handle errors
							in the console. useEffect is a React hook used to manage side effects, like fetching data.
							Today, I managed to structure my app by creating a services folder with an api-client.ts and
							an apiKey.ts file. This modular approach helped keep things clean and organized.</p>

						<p>2. <b>AbortController</b>:
							This was a new concept for me. The AbortController is used to cancel HTTP requests, which
							helps prevent unwanted re-renders or remounting due to React's strict implementation. I used
							it to signal the request cancellation once the data was fetched, making my app more
							efficient.</p>

						<p>3. <b>Weather Icons</b>:
							Initially, I thought I’d just hardcode icons based on the weather type. But then, I realized
							I could use an array to store the icons and dynamically reference them using the index. This
							was a simple array iteration concept, but with React, I didn’t have to manually loop through
							as I would in vanilla JavaScript. Also, I learned how to use as keyof typeof for arrays,
							which helps avoid undefined errors when indexing.</p>
						<span class="image main"><img src="images/screenshot of my weather app.webp"
								alt="screenshot of my weather app built with react" loading="lazy" /></span>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Challenges:</h4>
						<p>I encountered some challenges fetching the data today, despite having worked with APIs
							before. Each API structure is different, so it took a bit of trial and error to map my data
							correctly. Some responses were arrays of objects, others were objects containing arrays and
							other objects. I quickly realized that logging the response in the console was essential for
							understanding the structure and ensuring I defined the correct props. It was a bit
							frustrating at times, but ultimately, I made it work, and that’s what matters. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Reflection:</h4>
						<p>Looking back, I would make sure to study the structure of the data before trying to fetch it,
							to better align my props with how the data is structured. There’s always room for
							improvement, but I’m proud of the progress I made today. One of the highlights was using
							React Hook Form and Bootstrap to create a dynamic input field, which allowed me to change
							the city in the weather app without hardcoding values. I had a similar experience while
							working on my expense tracker project, so it felt great to apply what I learned in one
							project to another seamlessly. To me, programming is all about taking an idea, explaining it
							clearly (even to yourself), and then implementing it with the right tools. If you can break
							it down, you can build it.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Goal:</h4>
						<p>My next goal is to deploy the weather app and refine it a bit before pushing it to GitHub
							Pages. I’m not focusing too much on UI/UX right now, but I’ll make sure to fine-tune it
							tomorrow before the deployment. I’ve also got my MSc project to consider, but for now, I’m
							staying motivated and pushing forward. No giving up!</p>
